## Roles/Responsibilities
SCRUM master (Isaac)
  - Organizing and leading sprint meetings including: 
	Sprint Planning - to define sprint goals
	Daily stand-ups - to track progress and address challenges
	Sprint Reviews - to demonstrate the completed work
	Sprint Retrospectives - to reflect on the process and improve for future sprints
  - Record attendance of group members at all classes and meetings.
  - Take notes at meetings for group members who aren’t present.
  - Identification and resolution of roadblocks that would impede the team’s progress.

Stand in SCRUM master (Jaed)
  - Acts as the SCRUM master if the SCRUM master is not present.

## Decisions
Decisions regarding the project will be made through a majority vote after discussion among group members. If an agreement can not be reached, the SCRUM master will make the final decision. Any decision that greatly impacts the project will be documented business/BUSINESSPLAN.md.

## Attendance
Attendance for classes and group meetings will be recorded by the SCRUM master.  If the SCRUM master is not present, the Stand in SCRUM master will take note of attendance and inform the SCRUM master.  The attendance record will be available to all group members as read only to assist with determining group participation at the end of the project.

A member who is late or going to miss a class or meeting will send a text in the group chat as soon as possible.

Members that miss a meeting will check in with the SCRUM master or Stand in SCRUM master if the SCRUM master was not present to get caught up on what they missed.

## Assignments
During the Sprint Planning meeting, members choose a task or tasks to work on during the week from the tasks that need to be completed that week.  If any members don't have a preference of tasks, or don't choose tasks, the SCRUM master will request them to do tasks that suit their abilities.  During or after tasks being assigned, members should discuss any questions or concerns about the tasks so that tasks can be swapped or resigned if needed.  It is the responsibility of each member to seek help from the group or SCRUM master if they are having difficulties completing their tasks during the scrum.

## Participation
Each group member is expected to utilize their skills to contribute to the project in a way that feels fair to the whole group.  This doesn’t mean that the programming tasks need to be split perfectly as there will be other tasks that contribute.  The SCRUM master’s responsibilities are considered separate, and will not be included when evaluating an individual’s contributions.

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums
Dedicated work times - These times are meant for all group members to work on the project at the same time or at a minimum be available to assist other members with issues or collaboration so that parts of the project that require collaboration between members can be accomplished at consistent times.  
Sundays from 10 am to noon.

Sprints will be once a week, starting Tuesday and ending the next Monday. (After previous week Review and Retrospective.)

Sprint Planning - 15-30 minutes - Monday, during class or after class.

Daily stand-ups - 10 minutes - Tuesday, Thursday at the start of class.  (Async on Discord if not enough time in class.)

Sprint Reviews - 15-30 min - Monday, during class or after class.

Sprint Retrospectives - 10 min - Monday, during class or after class after the Sprint Review.

## Agenda and Minutes/Notes
The meeting agenda and notes will be taken by the SCRUM master.  The agenda will be made available to all group members at least 24 hours before a meeting.  The meeting notes will be posted on Discord after each meeting.

## Promptness
Expectations for this team is for work to be handed in on time within the proper sprint increment, and maintaining an equal amount of work distribution.  If a member is struggling or unable to complete a task, the member needs to inform the SCRUM master as soon as possible so that the task can be resigned or assisted with and completed during the Sprint if possible.

## Conversational Courtesies
 The team will promote and reinforce active listening by maintaining the conversation about the project and providing any sort of constructive feedback or criticism. These sort of conversational courtesies are mostly exercised throughout SCRUM meetings. Any sort of dialogue in the conversation is supposed to remain respectful.

## Enforcement/Feedback
 Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional are unwelcome in the team. As a team we are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Any sort of feedback is welcome as long as it contributes to the project. Feedback or enforcement can be reported either in the project Board in Github, during team discussions, and/or directly to professor Mazzone. Through following enforcement and feedback policies we are allowed to promote a healthy working environment and open to constructive criticism.
