# A/B Testing Plan

## "+" Button Placement for Adding Plants
- **User Story Number**: #17 Golden Path
- **Metrics**: Task Success, Engagement
- **Hypothesis**: Users will have a higher task success rate and better engagement when the "+" button is placed on a separate popup screen rather than on the plant's box.  
- **Problem Statement**: Users may overlook the "+" button if it's only available on the plant's box. A dedicated popup screen may provide a clearer and more focused interface for adding plant details, potentially improving completion rates and user satisfaction.  
- **Experiment**: 
  - Randomly assign users to one of two groups:
    - **Group A**: The "+" button is located on the plant's box, allowing users to add plants directly from there.
    - **Group B**: Clicking on a plant opens a popup screen with the "+" button and additional plant details.
  - Track user interactions using Firebase Analytics to monitor completion rates and clicks on the "+" button.
  
- **Variations**: 
  - **Variation A**: "+" button is on the plant's box.
  - **Variation B**: "+" button is on a dedicated popup screen after clicking on the plant.
  
- **Mockups/Designs**: 
  - Create wireframes showcasing:
    - Variation A: Plant box with "+" button directly accessible.
    - Variation B: Popup screen that appears with additional information and the "+" button for adding the plant.
